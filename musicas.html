<h4>letra</h4>
<p>First things first
    I'ma say all the words inside my head <br>
    I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh <br>
    The way that things have been, oh-ooh <br>
    Second thing second <br>
    Don't you tell me what you think that I could be <br>
    I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh <br>
    The master of my sea, oh-ooh <br>
    I was broken from a young age <br>
    Taking my sulking to the masses <br>
    Writing my poems for the few <br>
    That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me <br>
    Singing from heartache from the pain <br>
    Taking my message from the veins <br>
    Speaking my lesson from the brain <br>
    Seeing the beauty through the... <br>
    Pain! <br>
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer <br>
    Pain! <br>
    You break me down and build me up, believer, believer <br>
    Pain! <br>
    Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain <br>
    My life, my love, my drive, it came from... <br>
    Pain! <br>
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer <br>
    First things first <br>
    Can you imagine what's about to happen? <br>
    It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons <br>
    And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin' <br>
    This is what's happenin' <br>
    Second thing second, I reckon immaculate <br>
    Sound about accurate <br>
    I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy <br>
    I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities <br>
    I know the passages come with some traffic <br>
    I start with from the basement, end up in the attic <br>
    And third thing third <br>
    Whoever call me out, they simply can't count <br>
    Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh <br>
    Is you a believer? <br>
    I get a unicorn out of a zebra <br>
    I wear my uniform like a tuxedo <br>
    This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather <br>
    Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader <br>
    I know the bloomin' don't come without rain <br>
    I know the losin' don't come without shame <br>
    I know the beauty don't come without hurt <br>
    Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last <br>
    I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne <br>
    I know that losin' don't come without game <br>
    I know that glory don't come without... <br>
    Don't come without... <br>
    Pain! <br>
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer <br>
    Pain! <br>
    You break me down and build me up, believer, believer <br>
    Pain <br>
    Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain <br>
    My life, my love, my drive, it came from... <br>
    Pain! <br>
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer <br>
    Last things last <br>
    By the grace of fire and flames <br>
    You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh <br>
    The blood in my veins, oh-ooh <br>
    But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing <br>
    Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down <br>
    It rained down, like... <br>
    Pain! <br>
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer <br>
    Pain! <br>
    You break me down and build me up, believer, believer <br>
    Pain <br>
    Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain <br>
    My life, my love, my drive, it came from... <br>
    Pain! <br>
    You made me a, you made me a believer, believer</p> <br>

<h4>letra</h4>
<p> Just a young gun with the quick fuse<br>
    I was uptight, wanna let loose<br>
    I was dreaming of bigger things<br>
    And wanna leave my own life behind<br>
    Not a yes sir, not a follower<br>
    Fit the box, fit the mold<br>
    Have a seat in the foyer, take a number<br>
    I was lightning before the thunder<br>
    Thunder, thunder<br>
    Thunder, thun', thunder<br>
    Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder<br>
    Thunder, thun', thunder<br>
    Thun-thun-thunder, thunder<br>
    Thunder, feel the thunder<br>
    Lightning then the thunder<br>
    Thunder, feel the thunder<br>
    Lightning then the thunder<br>
    Thunder, thunder<br>
    Thunder<br>
    Kids were laughing in my classes<br>
    While I was scheming for the masses<br>
    Who do you think you are?<br>
    Dreaming 'bout being a big star<br>
    They say you're basic, they say you're easy<br>
    You're always riding in the back seat<br>
    Now I'm smiling from the stage while<br>
    You were clapping in the nose bleeds<br>
    Thunder<br>
    Thunder, thun', thunder<br>
    Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder<br>
    Thunder, thun', thunder<br>
    Thun-thun-thunder, thunder<br>
    Thunder, feel the thunder<br>
    Lightning then the thunder<br>
    Thunder, feel the thunder<br>
    Lightning then the thunder<br>
    Thunder<br>
    Thunder, feel the thunder<br>
    Lightning then the thunder, thunder<br>
    Thunder, feel the thunder<br>
    Lightning then the thunder, thunder<br>
    Thunder, feel the thunder<br>
    Lightning then the thunder, thunder<br>
    Thunder, feel the thunder<br>
    Lightning then the thunder, thunder<br>
    Thunder, feel the thunder<br>
    Lightning then the thunder, thunder<br>
    Thunder, thunder, thunder<br>
    Thun-thun-thunder, thunder<br>
    Thunder, thunder, thunder<br>
    Thun-thun-thunder, thunder<br>
    Thunder, thunder, thunder<br>
    Thun-thun-thunder, thunder<br>
    Thunder, thunder, thunder<br>
    Thun-thun-thunder, thunder</p><br>

<h4>letra</h4>
<p> I'm waking up to ash and dust <br>
    I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust <br>
    I'm breathing in the chemicals <br>
     <br>
    I'm breaking in, shaping up <br>
    Then checking out on the prison bus <br>
    This is it, the apocalypse, ooh <br>
     <br>
    I'm waking up <br>
    I feel it in my bones <br>
    Enough to make my system blow <br>
    Welcome to the new age, to the new age <br>
    Welcome to the new age, to the new age <br>
     <br>
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <br>
    Oh, oh, oh, oh <br>
    I'm radioactive, radioactive <br>
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <br>
    Oh, oh, oh, oh <br>
    I'm radioactive, radioactive <br>
     <br>
    I raise my flag and dye my clothes <br>
    It's a revolution, I suppose <br>
    We're painted red to fit right in, ooh <br>
     <br>
    I'm breaking in, shaping up <br>
    Then checking out on the prison bus <br>
    This is it, the apocalypse, ooh <br>
     <br>
    I'm waking up <br>
    I feel it in my bones <br>
    Enough to make my system blow <br>
    Welcome to the new age, to the new age <br>
    Welcome to the new age, to the new age <br>
     <br>
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <br>
    Oh, oh, oh, oh <br>
    I'm radioactive, radioactive <br>
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <br>
    Oh, oh, oh, oh <br>
    I'm radioactive, radioactive <br>
     <br>
    All systems go <br>
    The Sun hasn't died <br>
    Deep in my bones <br>
    Straight from inside <br>
     <br>
    I'm waking up <br>
    I feel it in my bones <br>
    Enough to make my system blow <br>
    Welcome to the new age, to the new age <br>
    Welcome to the new age, to the new age <br>
     <br>
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <br>
    Oh, oh, oh, oh <br>
    I'm radioactive, radioactive <br>
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <br>
    Oh, oh, oh, oh <br>
    I'm radioactive, radioactive</p> <br>
